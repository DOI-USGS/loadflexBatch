# loadflexBatch

This repository contains a demo script and data for running the `loadflex` 
package in batch mode, i.e., for multiple sites, constituents, and models.

While we are committed to sharing our scripts openly, and you are welcome to
try the scripts yourself, the contents of this repository were created for a
specific application, and we do not have the resources to update these scripts
or provide support for their use by others.

To install or update `loadflex`, see the README at 
[https://github.com/USGS-R/loadflex#installation](https://github.com/USGS-R/loadflex#installation).
You will likely have the most success with these `loadflexBatch` scripts if you use
`loadflex` version 1.1.11, which can be installed with

```r
devtools::install_github('USGS-R/loadflex@v1.1.11')
```

For a description of this repository's contents, and instructions on how to use 
the scripts contained here, see
