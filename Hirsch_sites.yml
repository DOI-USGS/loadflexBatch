# This YAML file contains high-level user options for running batch.R on a
# specific dataset. YAML files are made of key: value pairs like the ones below.
# Edit the values (the text to the right of each colon) to describe your data.

# Input files
inputFolder: "Hirsch_sites/input" # folder containing all input files and subfolders
constituents: ["NO23"] # names of folders inside inputFolder containing constituent data, and the column names for constituents within those data files
discharge: "Q" # name of the folder inside inputFolder containing daily discharge data, and the column name for discharge within those data files
date: "date" # column name for dates within the constituent and discharge data files
siteInfo: "siteInfo.csv" # name of the csv file inside inputFolder containing site and constituent metadata

# Analysis specifications
models: ["RL5","RL7","CMP","INT","BRE"] # models to run; choose any/all of ["RL5","RL7","CMP","INT","BRE"]
minDaysPerYear: 345 # number of days required for a year to be included in the multi-year average
regMaxNaNsPerYear: 0 # affects rloadest models only: max NaN days allowed for including year in annual or multi-year loads; estimates with NaNs can be very slow

# Units for output
loadUnits: "kg"
loadRateUnits: "kg y^-1"

# Output folder
outputFolder: "Hirsch_sites/output" # folder where results files and subfolders will be written
outputTimestamp: FALSE # if TRUE, output folder appended with DATE_TIME
